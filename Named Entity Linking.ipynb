    "A crucial part of question answering over knowledge graphs is identification of named entities in the question, and disambiguating and linking them to the corresponding ID in the KG. There are two challenges: recognizing strings as named entities, and finding the intended entity in the KG. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Spacy, we can use the built-in entity annotation layer for entity recognition. Also, there are various options to integrate entity linking in the spacy annotation pipeline. We explore these options below, with wikidata as KG. In all experiments, we use a set of 50 questions about the movies and actors as test data. All experiments done with Spacy 3.1 \n",

Titles such as *'Doctor Who'* or *'O Brother Where Art Thou'* can confuse the sentence segmenter and may lead to Spacy to think that somewhere in the title a new sentence starts. To avoid this problem, and as we already know that each input is exactly one sentence, we use the custom splitter below as suggested by the Spacy documentation.\n"
